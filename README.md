# Python Project: Portfolio Optimization Based on Investors Maximum Accepted Drawdown, Using Expected Shortfall
# Background:
Investing can be a stressfull endevour. While the positive stock market return expectation is not only broadly known but also scientifically documented (see Dimson et al. 2002), many potential investors shy away from the potential risks and fail to benefit from the economic miricale public markets provide. Others pay large fees to financial advisors to reduce the volatility of their portfolios. What if individuals could specify their: publicly traded securities and risk tolerance to obtain tailor made portfolio weightings?

# Solution: 
Our Python program equips individual investors with the power to choose their optimal asset weightings based on Markowitz (1952) portfolio selection. We achieve this by combining Markowitz portfolio optimization with the concept of expected shortfall (ES). ES is the amount of money an investor stands to loose given an extreme (negative) event in public market occurs. It is defined as a risk measure used to estimate the average loss of an investment portfolio in the worst-case scenario beyond a specified confidence level. We therefore assume historical returns to be a reliable predictors of future returns when observing a reasonably long time horizon. SPECIFY TIME HORIZON
